<h1>Stock Pitch of Vulcan Steel</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This was for a competition run by Forsyth Barr and the University of Auckland Investment Club. We pitched Vulcan Steel, entering the open division. We finished in the top five, as judges did not believe in the stock, although we received special praise for presentation quality and knowledge of the company during questioning.

Attached in the files is our deck and a few previews below.
